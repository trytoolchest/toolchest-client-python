# Adding and Updating Custom Databases

You can add or update custom reference databases using Toolchest – the interface is the same as running any tool, 
except `inputs` is replaced by `database_path`.

Adding and updating databases function as [Async Runs](async-runs.md). The `add_database` and 
`update_database` functions return after transferring the data with:

- a unique ID that you can use with `.get_status()` to track status
- the new `database_name` and `database_version`

##  Adding a Custom Database

You can add a custom database for any tool that exists in Toolchest. 

The custom database must already be generated for the specific tool. For example, the custom database for Kraken 2 must 
be generated by `kraken2-build` rather than a collection of FASTQ files.

Arguments:

- `database_path`:  Path or list of paths (local or S3) to file(s) containing the custom database. This can also be a
single path to a directory; see [this section](#preserving-file-structure).
- `tool`: Toolchest tool class with which you use the database (e.g. `toolchest.tools.DiamondBlastp`, 
`toolchest.tools.Kraken2`).
- `database_name`: Name of the new custom database.
- `database_primary_name`: If you are uploading multiple database files and your tool takes in a certain file or prefix 
instead of the whole directory as its command-line argument, use this to specify the name of that file or prefix.
See [this section](#specifying-database_primary_name) for more details.

The return is a `Toolchest.api.Output` object, containing:

- `database_name`
- `database_version`
- `run_id`

Here's an example of adding a custom database for Kraken 2 using an S3 prefix URI.

```python
import toolchest_client as tc

tc.set_key("YOUR_KEY")

tc.update_database(
  # arbitrary-directory is a prefix containing files like arbitrary-directory/db.files.1
  database_path="s3://example-s3-bucket/arbitrary-directory/",
  tool=tc.tools.Kraken2,
  database_name="example-db-name",
  database_primary_name="db.files",
)
```

!!! note "When will my database be ready to use?"
    It takes time for the database to transfer to our system. Once the add / update run has a status of 
    `ready_to_transfer_to_client`, you're good to go. You can check the status 
    [with these steps](async-runs.md#checking-run-status).

##  Updating a Custom Database

You can create a new custom version for any tool and database in Toolchest. This is very similar to adding a custom 
database, except the `database_name` for the database must already exist.

Arguments:

- `database_path`:  Path or list of paths (local or S3) to file(s) containing the custom database. This can also be a
single path to a directory; see [this section](#preserving-file-structure).
- `tool`: Toolchest tool class with which you use the database (e.g. `toolchest.tools.DiamondBlastp`, 
`toolchest.tools.Kraken2`).
- `database_name`: Name of the _existing_ database.
- `database_primary_name`: If you are uploading multiple database files and your tool takes in a certain file or prefix 
instead of the whole directory as its command-line argument, use this to specify the name of that file or prefix.
See [this section](#specifying-database_primary_name) for more details.

!!! note "`database_primary_name` is optional for `update_database`"
    If omitted, it assumes the same `database_primary_name` as the previous version of the custom database.

Returns a `Toolchest.api.Output` object, containing:

- `database_name`
- `database_version` (auto-incremented from the latest version)
- `run_id`

Here's an example update of the standard Kraken 2 database:

```python
import toolchest_client as tc

tc.set_key("YOUR_KEY")

tc.update_database(
  database_path=[
    "s3://example-s3-bucket-for-databases/my_db_directory/db.files.1",
    "s3://example-s3-bucket-for-databases/my_db_directory/db.files.2",
  ],
  tool=tc.tools.Kraken2,
  database_name="standard",
  database_primary_name="db.files",
)
```

## Preserving File Structure
You can use a directory as your `database_path`. For both local and S3 paths, using a directory will place all files
in their implied subdirectories.

If a list of paths is used instead, file structure will not be preserved. All files will be placed into 
the same directory.

## Using `database_primary_name`
Let's say you have a tool that you would run from the command line like this:
```commandline
some_command --database databases/my_db
```
For custom databases, we can't be sure about what `databases/my_db` actually is. `my_db` could either represent a
directory, a file itself, or multiple files -- it depends on the context of the tool. 

To pass that context to Toolchest, use `database_primary_name`. If `--database` refers to a path that isn't a directory, 
use `database_path` for the directory and `database_primary_name` for the filename or prefix.

Here's an example call for Bowtie 2, where `my_db` is a prefix for multiple files within `databases/`:
```python
import toolchest_client as tc
tc.add_database(
    tool=tc.tools.Bowtie2,
    database_name="example_name_for_my_new_database",
    database_path="databases/",
    database_primary_name="my_db",
)
```

### Use cases
1. If your database is a directory itself, such as `databases/my_db/{various database files}`, then use 
`database_primary_name=None`:
```python
tc.add_database(
    database_path="databases/my_db",
    database_primary_name=None,
    ...
)
```
2. If your database is a single database file, such as `databases/my_db`, or a prefix, such as:
```text
databases/
├── my_db.file1
├── my_db.file2
└── my_db.file3
```
then use `database_primary_name=my_db`:
```python
tc.add_database(
    database_path="databases/",
    database_primary_name="my_db",
    ...
)
```

### Behavior differences for `update_database`
For `update_database`, `database_primary_name` is optional. If omitted, it assumes the same value as the 
previous version of the custom database.

If `database_primary_name` needs to be changed to `None`  for future versions of the database, contact Toolchest to update the primary
name.

## Security

By default, the privacy setting of all custom databases is the equivalent of "unlisted". This means that if anybody 
else knows the name and version of your database, they can access it.

We support fully private custom databases as a part of the managed-hosted and on-prem versions of Toolchest.
