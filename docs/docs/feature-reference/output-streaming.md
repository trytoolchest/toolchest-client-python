# Live-Streaming Tool Output

For synchronous runs for Python and Lug, Toolchest supports streaming remote output live to wherever you're running 
Toolchest.


For example, here's a `python3` Toolchest call with streaming enabled and an example script:
```python
import toolchest_client as tc
tc.set_key("YOUR_KEY")
tc.python3(
    script="script.py",
    streaming_enabled=True,
)
```

```python
# script.py
import time
for letter in ["A", "B", "C"]:
    print(f"Hello world {letter}")
    time.sleep(1)
```

You'll see the following lines printed as they are generated by the remotely-running Python script, one line per second:
```text
Hello world A
Hello world B
Hello world C
```


!!! note "Streaming and cancelling runs"
    
    With streaming enabled, tool execution terminates if the streaming connection is broken. This includes cancelling
    your job by entering Ctrl-C. 
    
    If a job is cancelled before encountering a bug in your script, the error may not be visible in Toolchest logs.

## Supported Tools
Output streaming is supported for `python3` and `lug`. For both, streaming is enabled by default.
