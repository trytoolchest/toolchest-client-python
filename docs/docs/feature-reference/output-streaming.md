# Live-Streaming Tool Output

For synchronous runs for Python and Lug, Toolchest supports streaming tool output live to your terminal.

By setting the argument `streaming_enabled=True`, lines will be printed to your terminal as they would otherwise be 
printed by the tool to stdout and stderr.

For example, here's a `python3` Toolchest call with streaming enabled and an example script:
```python
import toolchest_client as tc

tc.set_key("YOUR_KEY")

tc.python3(
    script="script.py",
    streaming_enabled=True,
)
```

```python
# script.py
import time
print("==> Begin streamed lines <==")
for number in range(5):
    print(number)
    time.sleep(1)
print("==> End streamed lines <==")
```

The Toolchest call will print the following lines:
```text
Beginning Toolchest analysis run.
Found 1 files to upload.
==> Begin streamed lines <==
0
1
2
3
4
==> End streamed lines <==
==> End of stream, connection closed by server <==                                                                      
Running 1 job | Duration: 0:01:20 | 1 job complete  
Checking output...

Your Toolchest run is complete! The run ID and output locations are included in the return.
```
The streamed lines will be printed as they are generated by the remotely-running Python script!

!!! note "Streaming and cancelling runs"
    With streaming enabled, tool execution terminates if the streaming connection is broken. This includes cancelling
    your job by entering Ctrl-C.

## Suppoted Tools
Output streaming is supported for `python3` and `lug`. For both, streaming is enabled by default.
