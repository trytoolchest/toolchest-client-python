# Live-Streaming Tool Output

For **synchronous** runs with select tools, Toolchest supports streaming tool output live to your terminal.

By setting the argument `streaming_enabled=True`, lines will be printed to your terminal as they would otherwise be 
printed by the tool to stdout and stderr.

For example, here's a `python3` Toolchest call with streaming enabled and an example script:
```python
import toolchest_client as tc

tc.set_key("YOUR_KEY")

tc.python3(
    script="script.py",
    streaming_enabled=True,
)
```

```python
# script.py
import time
print("==> Begin streamed lines <==")
for number in range(5):
    print(number)
    time.sleep(1)
print("==> End streamed lines <==")
```

The Toolchest call will print the following lines:
```text
Beginning Toolchest analysis run.
Found 1 files to upload.
==> Begin streamed lines <==
0
1
2
3
4
==> End streamed lines <==
==> End of stream, connection closed by server <==                                                                      
Running 1 job | Duration: 0:01:20 | 1 job complete  
Checking output...

Your Toolchest run is complete! The run ID and output locations are included in the return.
```
The streamed lines will be printed as they are generated by the remotely-running Python script!

## Suppoted Tools
Output streaming is supported for `python3` and `lug`. For both, streaming is **enabled** by default. 

## Troubleshooting
If output streaming is enabled, tool execution will also be tied to the output stream. This means that
if the streaming connection is broken, tool execution will also stop.

For failed runs, try re-running with streaming disabled by toggling `streaming_enabled=False`.
