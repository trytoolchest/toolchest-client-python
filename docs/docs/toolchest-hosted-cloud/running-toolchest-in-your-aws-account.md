# Running Toolchest in your AWS account

If you just want to enable Toolchest to pull from your S3 buckets, check out 
[Using AWS with Toolchest](../feature-reference/using-aws-with-toolchest.md).

You can also set up Toolchest to run instances in your own AWS account. We're gating this feature for now, so let us 
know if you'd like access.
