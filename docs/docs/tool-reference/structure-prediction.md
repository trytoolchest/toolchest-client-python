Structure prediction takes an input protein sequence and predicts the shape of its three dimensional structure.

Recent advances – including [AlphaFold](structure-prediction/alphafold.md) – make use of deep learning, making use of 
GPUs and terabytes of pre-trained reference databases to predict 3D structure.

AlphaFold 2 is one of the few structure prediction tools that's hosted on Toolchest, but 
[let us know](https://airtable.com/shrNBkD0bG2wB15jQ) if there's another tool that you'd like to use!
