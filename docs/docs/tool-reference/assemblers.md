Genome assemblers take partial sequences of a genome and assemble them to form a larger contiguous sequence – ideally, the whole genome.

The best assemblers work with both short reads (e.g. Illumina) and long reads (e.g. Oxford Nanopore) to quickly assemble a genome (e.g. [Unicycler](assemblers/unicycler.md)).

If you want to use an assembler that's not listed here, [let us know](https://airtable.com/shrNBkD0bG2wB15jQ)! It might even be already available on our infrastructure but not listed.
