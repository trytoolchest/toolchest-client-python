Demultiplexing is extracting components from something that's all mixed together. It's like taking a rope and unwinding
each individual thread.

Sometimes, this means using a straightforward tool like `bcl2fastq` to generate FASTQs from raw Illumina NGS reads. 
Just for fun, we've also included an ML-based tool called [Demucs](demultiplexers/demucs.md) to separate song tracks.
